# Happy Garden is a game that allows the player to press the space bar to water plants that wilt
# If a flower is wilted for 10 seconds then the game is over
# If a flower is not wilted for at least 15 seconds it will become a fangflower that chases the game actor
# If a fangflower collides with the game actor then the game is over
# The player's score is measured by each second that is added to the time in the top-left corner of the screen
